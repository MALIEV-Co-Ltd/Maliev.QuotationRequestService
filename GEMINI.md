# Maliev.QuotationRequestService Migration to .NET 9

This document summarizes the key changes and rationale behind the migration of the `Maliev.QuotationRequestService` project to .NET 9, incorporating best practices for API development and deployment.

## Key Changes Made

*   **Target Framework Update**: Migrated all projects (`Maliev.QuotationRequestService.Api`, `Maliev.QuotationRequestService.Common`, `Maliev.QuotationRequestService.Data`, `Maliev.QuotationRequestService.Tests`) to `net9.0`.
*   **Project Structure Refinement**: 
    *   Re-created projects with modern .NET 9 templates.
    *   Established correct project references based on the original dependency graph.
*   **API Controller Refinement**:
    *   Introduced **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)** (`RequestDto`, `CreateRequestRequest`, `UpdateRequestRequest`, `RequestFileDto`, `CreateRequestFileRequest`, `UpdateRequestFileRequest`) for clear API contracts and robust input validation using `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations`.
    *   Implemented a **Service Layer** (`IQuotationRequestServiceService`, `QuotationRequestServiceService`) to encapsulate business logic, separating concerns from the controller.
    *   Controllers now depend on the service layer interface (`IQuotationRequestServiceService`) instead of directly on the `DbContext`.
    *   Controllers use DTOs for their method signatures.
    *   Ensured all API operations are asynchronous (`async/await`).
*   **`Program.cs` Replication**: Meticulously replicated the `Program.cs` file from the `reference_project` to ensure adherence to established patterns for:
    *   Service Registration Order
    *   Authentication (`AddAuthentication()`, `AddJwtBearer()`)
    *   API Versioning (`.AddApiExplorer()`)
    *   Swagger Configuration (using `IApiVersionDescriptionProvider`, `OpenApiInfo`, `OpenApiSecurityScheme`)
    *   CORS (named policy, specific origins)
    *   Exception Handling (`UseExceptionHandler`)
    *   Middleware Pipeline Order (`UsePathBase`, `UseHttpsRedirection`, `UseCors`, `UseAuthentication`, `UseAuthorization`, etc.)
*   **Entity and DbContext Re-implementation**: Analyzed the source `DbContext`'s `OnModelCreating` method to correctly define `required` and nullable (`?`) properties in the new entities (`Request`, `RequestFile`).
*   **Test Refactoring**:
    *   Service layer tests (`QuotationRequestServiceServiceTests`) were refactored to use `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory` for reliable and isolated testing of business logic.
    *   Controller tests (`RequestsControllerTests`, `RequestFilesControllerTests`) were implemented to mock the service layer, verifying correct HTTP response logic.

## Rationale

The migration aimed to bring `Maliev.QuotationRequestService` in line with modern .NET development standards, improve maintainability, testability, and security, and ensure consistency with other services like `Maliev.AuthService` and `Maliev.JobService`. By adopting DTOs, a service layer, externalized secret management, and refactored tests, the project is now more robust, scalable, and easier to deploy in a cloud-native environment.

## Important Considerations

*   **Secrets in Google Secret Manager**: Ensure the `JwtSecurityKey`, `Jwt:Issuer`, `Jwt:Audience`, and `ConnectionStrings-QuotationRequestServiceDbContext` secrets are correctly configured in Google Secret Manager before deployment.
*   **`SecretProviderClass`**: Verify that the `maliev-shared-secrets` `SecretProviderClass` is correctly applied to your Kubernetes cluster and configured to fetch the necessary secrets from Google Secret Manager.
*   **Local Development Secrets**: For local development, use Visual Studio's User Secrets to manage sensitive information. Instructions for setting these locally are provided in the `README.md`.
*   **Build and Test**: Always run `dotnet build` and `dotnet test` after any changes to ensure project integrity.
